Hi, my name is Yueting Zhang (Freda). 
It's a pleasure to meet you all. 
I got my Bachelor Degree in Applied Mathematics. 
Economics has always fascinated me with its intricate understanding of how societies allocate resources and make decisions. 
While my experience in programming may not be extensive, I find it both interesting and challenging. 
The ability to extract meaningful insights from data is incredibly powerful. 
I hope through this course,  I can be more experienced at programing. 
Thanks!
